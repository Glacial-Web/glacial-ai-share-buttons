== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I customize the button section title? =

Go to Settings > Glacial AI Share Buttons in your WordPress admin and modify the "Button Section Title" field.

= Can I control the buttons on specific posts? =

Yes! When editing a post, you'll find an "AI Share Buttons" meta box in the sidebar with two options:
- "Show AI buttons on this post" - Forces buttons to appear on this specific post
- "Hide AI buttons on this post" - Prevents buttons from appearing on this specific post

You can also use the global "Add AI buttons on ALL posts" setting in the plugin settings to control the default behavior site-wide.

= Which AI services are supported? =

The plugin supports Google AI Mode, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Grok, and Meta AI. You can also add custom AI tools using the repeater feature and configure custom URLs for each service. You can enable/disable each service individually in the settings.

= Will the buttons work with my theme? =

Yes! The plugin uses CSS that inherits your theme's button styling and includes responsive design that works with most themes.

= Are the buttons accessible? =

Yes, the plugin includes accessibility features like high contrast mode support, reduced motion support, and proper semantic HTML.

= How do I add custom AI tools? =

Use the repeater feature in the plugin settings to add unlimited custom AI services. You can configure the button name, URL, and icon for each custom AI tool.

= Can I customize the URLs for AI services? =

Yes! You can configure custom URLs for each AI service in the plugin settings, allowing you to use specific prompts or parameters for your content.

= How does URL validation work? =

The plugin includes comprehensive URL validation that works in real-time. Invalid URLs are prevented from being saved, and you'll see clear error messages for any issues. The validation checks for proper URL format and ensures URLs start with http:// or https://.

= Is my data secure? =

Yes! The plugin uses WordPress's built-in security functions and includes protection against SQL injection attacks. All user input is properly sanitized and validated before being stored.

= Can I choose which post types display the AI buttons? =

Yes! In the Glacial AI Share Buttons settings, you'll find a "Post Types" section where you can select which content types should display the AI share buttons. You can choose from Posts, Pages, Resources, Webinars, or any custom post types on your site. By default, only Posts are selected to maintain backward compatibility.
